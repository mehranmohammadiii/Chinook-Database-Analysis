## üß™ Usage

# üéµ Chinook SQL Server Practice Project

This project is designed for practicing and improving SQL Server skills using the real-world **Chinook** database.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Usage ‚Äî How to Install & Use the Chinook Database

### üéß Download the Chinook Database

1. Download the Chinook database from the official GitHub repository:  
üëâ [Chinook Database GitHub](https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database)

2. You can either download the ZIP file directly or clone the repository using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database.git
```

### üóÑÔ∏è Installing Chinook Database on SQL Server

1. After downloading, navigate to the following path:

```
chinook-database > ChinookDatabaseScripts > Chinook_SqlServer.sql
```

2. Open the `Chinook_SqlServer.sql` file in **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**.

3. Make sure the database is created properly by running this part of the script:

```sql
USE [master];
GO
CREATE DATABASE [Chinook];
GO
USE [Chinook];
```

4. Once the database is created, select all content of the `.sql` script and execute it.  
If the script runs successfully, the `Chinook` database will be ready on your SQL Server instance.


### üß† Notes

- Chinook is a lightweight sample database designed for training and testing.
- The database simulates a digital music store with tables for Customers, Invoices, Tracks, Albums, Artists, and more.
- Perfect for practicing SQL concepts like `SELECT`, `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `Stored Procedures`, `Views`, `Functions`, `Triggers` and advanced querying.
