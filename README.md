# 🎬Chinook-Database-Analysis

This project is a comprehensive SQL-based analysis of the **Chinook Sample Database**, covering key insights and behaviors of customers, Artists, Tracks, and Invoices.

All logic is implemented in a single SQL script file:
**Chinook_analysis.sql**
Running this file will create all the necessary **views**, **stored procedures**, and **functions** in your SQL SERVER Chinook database.
